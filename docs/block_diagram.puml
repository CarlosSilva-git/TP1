' Main components
[Main Application] as main
[ADC Module] as adc
[UART Module] as uart
[IO Module] as io
[LED Controller] as led

' Hardware components
component "ADC Hardware" as adc_hw
component "UART Hardware" as uart_hw
component "LED (Pin PB5)" as led_hw

' Interfaces
interface "Analog Input" as analog
interface "Serial Communication" as serial
interface "Digital Output" as digital

' Relationships
main --> adc : uses
main --> uart : uses
main --> io : uses
io --> led : creates

adc --> adc_hw : controls
uart --> uart_hw : controls
led --> led_hw : controls

analog --> adc_hw : reads voltage
uart_hw --> serial : transmits data
led_hw --> digital : outputs PWM

note right of main
  Main loop:
  - Reads ADC (every 500ms)
  - Converts to voltage
  - Sends via UART
  - Controls LED brightness
end note

note right of adc
  ADC Features:
  - 10-bit resolution
  - Voltage conversion
end note

note right of uart
  UART Settings:
  - 9600 baud rate
  - String transmission
end note

note right of led
  LED Control:
  - ON/OFF control
  - Brightness adjustment (0-255)
  - Pin PB5 (Arduino 13)
end note
